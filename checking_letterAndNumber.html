// [^] this means you want to match any character that is not specified within the square bracket --- catch any outside character not within the square bracket. 
//[^a-z] your regular expression matches any character that is not between a to z
// [^a-z]/i -- you have just made the filtering a lot easier -- with making it case insensitive 
// [^a-z\d ]/i --- you have just allowed digits and characters from a to z, making it case insensitive, also you have allowed spce which means anything other than a to z, digits, and space will be rendered invalid 

//myRegExp.test(text) === true ( returning true means it caught an illegal passphrase ); 
//isValid -- yes or no -- yes means no illegal characters 
// no means -- illegal characters found
